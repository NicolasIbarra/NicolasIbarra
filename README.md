ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is NicolÃ¡s Ibarra and I'm a Computer Engineering student. I'm currently working on my final thesis project which is about recyclable waste recognition using AI. 

Besides this, I'm interested in becoming a frontend developer, so this repo will be in it's majority about JavaScript.

Now with that said, I hope you enjoy the projects I will regularly upload. 

See you!
