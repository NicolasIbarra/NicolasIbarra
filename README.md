ğŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is NicolÃ¡s Ibarra and I'm a Computer Engineer.

I'm interested in becoming a NodeJS backend developer and I've a little experiencie in frontend development, so this repo will be in it's majority about JavaScript.

Now with that said, I hope you enjoy the projects I will regularly upload. 

See you!
